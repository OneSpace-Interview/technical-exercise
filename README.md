# OneSpace Techncial Interview Exercise

This repo contains source code for technical exercises conducted throughout the OneSpace interview process



Notes on Code Review:

Best guess:
Difficulty renders buttons and provides a "pre" game interface, where the "everything else" is the actual game.  Sure, you can abstract the game into 1000 different files, but the more you abstract, the harder it is to read.  I think separating the pre-game and the game is probably a good sweet spot for this, since the game isn't too large in and of itself, and since the pre-game is distinctly separate from the game on a user level.  

Skill at this game:
0/10

How to win:
Turn off lava and decrease gravity
